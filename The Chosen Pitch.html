<h2> City Circulation </h2>
<p>In 2012 Washington DC broke new ground in disability advocacy with a mission to outfit each and every Metrorail station with elevators and gap reducers to make them fully accessible for disabled patrons.  Today, all 86 stations in the system are fully<a href="http://www.wmata.com/accessibility/">accesible.</a></p>
<p>The continued development of New York City's subway is reaching a peak in debate, specifically just what demographic are they appealing too.  For some time the city has sought to wealthier visitors, with some critics and architects <a href="http://nextcity.org/theworks/entry/new-yorks-next-mayor-should-build-transit-for-the-boroughs-not-globetrottin">arguing billions</a> to be spent on a direct line from JFK and LaGuardia airports into the heart of the city, while low income neighborhoods like East Harlem and south Brooklyn are still not represented by convenient subways locations.</p>
<p>Even more glaring, when juxtaposed with the Washington DC Metrorail and accessibility concerns, the New York City MTA subway system appears to be operating behind the curve.  While 100% of Metrorail stations are accessible, only<a href="http://web.mta.info/accessibility/">110</a> of the New York City's 468 stations are accessible according to American Disability Act standards: a whopping 24%.  Even that is deceiving, as some of those stations do not have the necessary <a href="http://www.pcac.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Bridging_The_Gap_FINAL.pdf">gap reducers for wheelchair users</a> and others only provide accessible service to a single line (or in some cases only the northbound/southbound trains of a line).</p>
<p>I aim to create an interactive map of the City's subway that shows the area each accessible stations serves.  I will use a geographically accurate map for this infographic, not the regular MTA map that uses approximations and<a href="http://benschmidt.org/mta/">widely distorts the communities served by the subway.</a> Also, the only stations highlighted will be those claiming to be handicap accessible.  Users will be able to scroll over such stations, and when they do a highlighted circumference will appear surrounding the specific stations showing how much area of the neighbourhood must use this station if they need accessibility.  This means that every square foot of the city will "correspond" to the nearest station.  The shading will relate to the colors of the line that stations serves, i.e. if the staion serves just the 4, 5, or 6 it will be solid green, and if it serves the 4, 5, 6 as well as the Q, R, N it will be shaded with alternating stripes of green and yellow.  There will also be a small text box with the specific lines and for stations that serve only the southbound or northbound trains of a line this text box will be display a warning sign in the background. Combined with on the ground reporting (interviews with several MTA officials as well as officials of the American Disability Association in New York City, I want to make this piece as informative as it is visually appealing. I plan to use this template <a href="http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4060366/">template</a>.</p>
<p>I believe this idea can be pitched to several organizations at several different levels.  One of the first option would be the <a href="http://www.pcac.org/nyctrc/history/">New York City Transit Riders Council (NYCTRC),</a>   but a smaller level could be used by Council Members or community advocates representing neighborhoods in Brooklyn, Queens, and the Bronx where the subway does not adequately serve the disabled populations.  Other advocacy organizations and legal representative like The Center for Disability Rights, Disability Rights Advocates, and even the Mayor's Office for People with Disabilities would also find this information useful.</p>
