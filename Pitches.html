<h2> The residential neighbourhood inside your fridge</h2>
<p>We've all seen them-colonies of bacteria making their way across the surface of cheese, cucumbers collapsed under the pressure of microscopic squatters, and the fuzzy  nomads basking in the stench of last week's potato salad. These are, the bacterial residents the make their way into our fridge. But how long does it take for them to stake their claim atop our food?</p>
<p>My project would be an interactive picture in which a user could click a link, open a virtual fridge filled with typical “fridge foods", and with the use of some kind of time-lapse coding for graphics watch food “go bad" after a certain number of days or weeks based on how long they hold the mouse over the graphic.</p>
<p>I'd like to make it scientifically engaging by including information about what kinds of bacteria are specific to certain foods and why those foods and the fridge provides the ideal environment for that organism.</p>
<p>I'd probably have to aggregate data on my own based on FDA regulations and suggestions for the shelf life of food. I think this is feasible because I don't plan on collecting this data for hundreds of foods. The bacterial info is also easily attainable from research sites and to keep the infographic internet friendly, I'd limit the bacterial profiles to just a few quick sentences.</p>
<p>There are a number of health blogs and science websites I could pitch this to including <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/pages/health/">The Health and Wellness blog of the New York Times</a> and <a href="http://www.livescience.com/"> Live Science</a>.</p>

<h2>Title IX: Where my girls at?</h2>
<p>In 2012, women and men across the United States celebrated the 40th anniversary of the landmark passing of <a href="http://www.dol.gov/oasam/regs/statutes/titleix.htm">Title IX as part of the Education Amendments of 1972</a>. In anticipation of the anniversary, the NCAA association-wide Committee on Women's Athletics commissioned the report<a href="http://www.ncaapublications.com/productdownloads/TITLEIX.pdf">“The Status of Women in Intercollegiate Athletics as Title IX Turns 40."</a> This report provides a narrative to the four decades with a focus on 1) Participation Opportunities; 2) Resource Allocations; and 3) Leadership Positions.  It provides incredibly in-depth data and charts representing the change over time of women's involvement in championship and emerging sports at NCAA Division 1, 2, and 3 schools and juxtaposes it with the participation of male student-athletes.</p>
<p>While the report covers many bases, it fails to address an important measure of Title IX's success: attendance records.  I would like to create an interactive map of the United States that shows the most popular NCAA Women's Championship Sports in each state as it has changed over the four decades of Title IX.  Users will be able to select what decade they want to see the map in: 1972-79, 1980-89, 1990-99, 2000-10.  Once selected, the map will show each state's most popular sport amongst NCAA Women's Championship Sports over that period of time.  When a user scrolls over a state it will show the total attendance numbers for the top three sports from that decade.</p>
<p>First, I will limit this infographic to dealing with<a href="http://www.ncaa.com/championships">Women's Division 1/National Championship sports</a>. The schools participating in NCAA Division 1 as Full Member Institutions are listed by state<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_NCAA_Division_I_institutions">here</a>.  Schools are required for every sport to report attendance either from ticket sales or crowd estimates.  Currently, there are 282 Full Member/Provisional Member Universities involved in NCAA Division 1 athletics and 20 different sports.  I will have to find an efficient way of retrieving each school's attendance records.  They are archived as public record on University's websites, but it might be more time-efficient to send requests for the information or to seek the information directly from the NCAA.</p>
The <a href="http://www.ncaa.com/">NCAA</a> is an obvious first-selection to pitch this too, but other likely interested organization and networks include<a href="http://www.womenssportsfoundation.org/">Women's Sports Foundation</a> and <a href="http://espn.go.com/espnw/news-commentary/">ESPNW</a>.

<h2> City Circulation </h2>
<p>In 2012 Washington DC broke new ground in disability advocacy with a mission to outfit each and every Metrorail station with elevators and gap reducers to make them fully accessible for disabled patrons.  Today, all 86 stations in the system are fully<a href="http://www.wmata.com/accessibility/">accesible.</a></p>
<p>The continued development of New York City's subway is reaching a peak in debate, specifically just what demographic are they appealing too.  For some time the city has sought to wealthier visitors, with some critics and architects <a href="http://nextcity.org/theworks/entry/new-yorks-next-mayor-should-build-transit-for-the-boroughs-not-globetrottin">arguing billions</a> to be spent on a direct line from JFK and LaGuardia airports into the heart of the city, while low income neighborhoods like East Harlem and south Brooklyn are still not represented by convenient subways locations.</p>
<p>Even more glaring, when juxtaposed with the Washington DC Metrorail and accessibility concerns, the New York City MTA subway system appears to be operating behind the curve.  While 100% of Metrorail stations are accessible, only<a href="http://web.mta.info/accessibility/">110</a> of the New York City's 468 stations are accessible according to American Disability Act standards: a whopping 24%.  Even that is deceiving, as some of those stations do not have the necessary <a href="http://www.pcac.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Bridging_The_Gap_FINAL.pdf">gap reducers for wheelchair users</a> and others only provide accessible service to a single line (or in some cases only the northbound/southbound trains of a line).</p>
<p>I aim to create an interactive map of the City's subway that shows the area each accessible stations serves.  I will use a geographically accurate map for this infographic, not the regular MTA map that uses approximations and<a href="http://benschmidt.org/mta/">widely distorts the communities served by the subway.</a> Also, the only stations highlighted will be those claiming to be handicap accessible.  Users will be able to scroll over such stations, and when they do a highlighted circumference will appear surrounding the specific stations showing how much area of the neighborhood must use this station if they need accessibility.  This means that every square foot of the city will “correspond" to the nearest station.  The shading will relate to the colors of the line that stations serves, i.e. if the staion serves just the 4, 5, or 6 it will be solid green, and if it serves the 4, 5, 6 as well as the Q, R, N it will be shaded with alternating stripes of green and yellow.  There will also be a small text box with the specific lines and for stations that serve only the southbound or northbound trains of a line this text box will be display a warning sign in the background.</p>
<p>I believe this idea can be pitched to several organizations at several different levels.  One of the first option would be the <a href="http://www.pcac.org/nyctrc/history/">New York City Transit Riders Council (NYCTRC),</a>   but a smaller level could be used by Council Members or community advocates representing neighborhoods in Brooklyn, Queens, and the Bronx where the subway does not adequately serve the disabled populations.  Other advocacy organizations and legal representative like The Center for Disability Rights, Disability Rights Advocates, and even the Mayor's Office for People with Disabilities would also find this information useful.</p>
